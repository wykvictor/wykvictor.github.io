### 1. [Heapify](http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/heapify/)
```
Given an integer array, heapify it into a min-heap array.
For a heap array A, A[0] is the root of heap, and for each A[i], A[i * 2 + 1] is the left child of A[i] and A[i * 2 + 2] is the right child of A[i].

Given [3,2,1,4,5], return [1,2,3,4,5] or any legal heap array.
O(n) time complexity
