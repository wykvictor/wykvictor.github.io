> Leetcode上增加了4道Shell题目，进行总结

### 1. [Tenth Line](https://leetcode.com/problems/tenth-line/)
```
How would you print just the 10th line of a file?
For example, assume that file.txt has the following content:
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10

Your script should output the tenth line, which is:
Line 10
```
a. `head -10 file.txt | tail -1`
   错误: 若文件只有9行，会打印出Line 9，但是应该不打印
   修改：tail -n +10 file.txt | head -n1 (+10代表从正数10行开始，如果没有就不输出)
   同理：若打印倒数第10行：head -n -10 404.html | tail -1

b. if语句实现相同功能：

{% highlight Bash shell scripts %}
if [ \`wc -l file.txt | awk '{print $1}'\` -gt 9 ]; then
	head -10 file.txt | tail -1
fi
{% endhighlight %}

c. `sed -n '10p' file.txt`
不带-n的话，不仅打印匹配行，还接着输出file的全部内容。

d. `awk 'NR == 10' file.txt` Number of Field, 默认是换行符，就是第几行

### 2. [Valid Phone Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-phone-numbers/)
```
Given a text file file.txt that contains list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.
You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)
You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.

For example, assume that file.txt has the following content:
	987-123-4567
	123 456 7890
	(123) 456-7890
Your script should output the following valid phone numbers:
	987-123-4567
	(123) 456-7890
```
